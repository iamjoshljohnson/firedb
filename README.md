# FireDB - Abandoned Project
FireDB - A Simple NoSQL Database Solution Written In PHP.

This project was originally started to explore what a flat file NoSQL database would look like if it were written in PHP. Boiled down, it was an awesome challenge that led to gaining a great understanding to the many challenges of building your own NoSQL solution. 

The reason we wanted to build our own NoSQL solutions in PHP is because we ultimately want to build out our [FireStudio](https://github.com/ua1-labs/firestudio) solution to be completely self contained with no need to connect to an outside data source.

We abandoned this project to start work on another NoSQL data solution, [FireSQL](https://github.com/ua1-labs/firesql). A lot of the code we wrote for FireDB ended up being used again with FireSQL.

If you wish, please feel free to pick up right where we left off in this project! Send us an email if you end up doing just that [development@ua1.us](mailto:development@ua1.us)
